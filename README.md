# Kashmir Programming Language - Draft

This is a draft for Kashmir programming language and a prototype compiler - a
statically typed LISP that compiles to native code using
[Go](https://golang.org/). By leveraging the Go runtime Kashmir gets
asynchronous IO, lightweight threads (Go routines) and a good GC.

## Documentation

The more extensive documentation, including details about the project and
how to program in Kashmir, is located at http://owickstrom.github.io/kashmir/.

## Experiments

Some samples and experiments of Kashmir source files and the output files to be
compiled with Go can be found in [`experiments/`](experiments).

## Usage

There's mostly tests for the moment, but also a simple REPL to try out stuff in.
Use `rlwrap` for a nicer experience. Make sure you have Go installed and setup
as described in [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html).

```bash
$ rlwrap racket repl.rkt
Welcome to Kashmir! Type CTRL-C to exit.

# Kashmir Programming Language - Draft

This is a draft for Kashmir programming language and a prototype
compiler - a statically typed LISPy language that compiles to native
code using [Go](https://golang.org/). By leveraging the Go runtime
Kashmir gets asynchronous IO, lightweight threads (Go routines) and a
good GC.

Kashmir is named after the powerful Led Zeppelin song.

## Documentation

Most documentation, including details about the project, how to run
the compiler and how to program in Kashmir, is located at
https://owickstrom.github.io/kashmir/.

## Experiments

Some samples and experiments of Kashmir source files and the output files to be
compiled with Go can be found in [`experiments/`](experiments).

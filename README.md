# Oden Programming Language 

**EXPERIMENTAL!**

Oden is a LISP-inspired language with static typing that compiles
to native code using Go. The current implementation is working draft
and **should be considered highly experimental**. See [Motivations
& Goals](http://oden-lang.org/motivation-and-goals.html) for
details.

## Documentation

Details about the project, how to install and run the compiler and how to
program in Oden is located at http://oden-lang.org.

For build instructions see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Experiments

Some samples and experiments of Oden source files and the output files to be
compiled with Go can be found in [`experiments/`](experiments).
